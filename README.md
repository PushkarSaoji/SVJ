# SVJ
Tying to find HV signatures at LHC.

[sift.h](sift.h) file is the header file which contains the code to cluster the event, and gives list of jets as output.
[trial.cc](trial.cc) is a sample pythia program which generates events from pythia, and then forms jets and subjets.
[QCD](QCD.dat) and [HV](HV.dat) are the pythia comaand files.
